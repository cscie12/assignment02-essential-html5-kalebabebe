    <h3>Affordable Housing Overlay</h3>
    <p>Adopted in October 2020, the 100%-Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) aims to accelerate the development of affordable homes cost-effectively. It permits denser affordable housing in areas with limited affordable options. By streamlining approval processes, AHO enables quicker creation of new affordable units, improving the efficiency of public funding use.</p>

    <h3>Cycling Safety Ordinance</h3>
    <p>In 2019, Cambridge City Council enacted the Cycling Safety Ordinance, prioritizing bike lane construction during street reconstructions, aligning with the Five-Year Plan for Streets and Sidewalks. In 2020, amendments set ambitious targetsâ€”installing about 25 miles of separated bike lanes in 5-7 years, guided by the Bicycle Network Vision. Details are in Chapter 12.22 of the Cambridge Municipal Code. Key areas for separated bike lanes include Massachusetts Ave, Broadway, Cambridge St, Hampshire St, Garden St, and 11.6 miles elsewhere in line with the Bicycle Network Vision.

    <h3>BEUDO</h3>
    <p>BEUDO (Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance) is a crucial initiative since 2014 to combat greenhouse gas emissions primarily from commercial and large residential buildings, which account for 80% of the city's emissions. BUEDO mandates annual energy consumption reporting and requires emissions reduction measures, aiming for Net Zero Emissions in large commercial buildings by 2035. Aligned with Cambridge's sustainability goals, the city oversees reporting, due annually by May 1st. For updates, residents can join the BUEDO email list or contact BUEDO@cambridgema.gov.</p>
